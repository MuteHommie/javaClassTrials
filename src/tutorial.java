        //Lets start with java itself;
        /*
        Java is both a programming language and a 'service'.
        Most know java as a programming language since its used to develop small and enterprise standard programs and apps;
        Java as a service is brought about by the services availed for used during the development of the said programs.

        This includes JVM, JRE and  JDK;
        The three work together in a given machine so as to ensure the program is well developed.
        JRE - java runtime environment is a collection of libraries and utilities that work together with the JVM to build the program.
        JVM - Java Virtual machine is a machine that works one layer above the operating system that enables interaction between the java program and the pc resources via the operating system.
        JDK - Is the whole development kit that ensures the java program is machine independent.
